DESCRIPTION					*radical*

Radical shows the value of the number under the cursor in decimal,
hexadecimal, octal, and binary representation. Radical uses <cword> (or the
Visual selection) to obtain the number in question and guesses the base.

This plugin depends on the |Maktaba| library.
This plugin requires an {installer} for the |bases| library to be available.

						*<Plug>RadicalView*
Radical defines a <Plug> mapping <Plug>RadicalView, in normal and Visual mode.

The default key mapping is g CTRL-A.

The base can be forced by giving a count, for example "16g<C-A>".
